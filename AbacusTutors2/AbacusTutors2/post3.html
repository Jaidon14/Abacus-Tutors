                    <h3>Our Beginning</h3>
                    <p>In the bustling heart of Alberton, Johannesburg, the seeds of Abacus Tutors were planted in the early 2010s.
                     The inception of this dedicated maths tutoring company can be traced back to the vision and passion of its founder, Callen Pulliah, a highly
                    skilled mathematician and educator with a dream to make quality mathematics education accessible to every student.<br><br>
                    Callen's journey began in a small classroom, where he provided personalized tutoring to a handful of students struggling with their math curriculum. Recognizing the widespread anxiety and difficulty many students faced with mathematics, Callen was inspired to create a supportive and enriching learning environment that fostered academic growth and confidence.
                     His teaching philosophy was simple yet powerful: to transform how students perceive and approach math by making it engaging, relatable, and understandable. <br><br>
                     Word of Callen's effective teaching methods quickly spread, and soon his classroom was filled with eager learners from all over Alberton. As demand grew, so did the need for a more structured and expansive platform.
                      This led to the official establishment of Abacus Tutors in 2015, named after the ancient tool that symbolizes the foundation of mathematical learning. <br><br>
                      Abacus Tutors set itself apart with its innovative teaching strategies and a curriculum designed to cater to individual learning styles. The company adopted a holistic approach, focusing not just on academic excellence but also on building students' confidence and problem-solving abilities.
                       The tutors at Abacus were carefully selected not only for their expertise in mathematics but also for their ability to inspire and connect with students. <br><br>
                       Over the years, Abacus Tutors expanded its reach, offering a variety of programs tailored for different age groups and academic levels, from primary school to high school students. The success stories of their students,
                        many of whom achieved top grades and developed a newfound love for mathematics, became the testament to the effectiveness of their approach. <br><br>
                        Community engagement played a crucial role in Abacus Tutors' growth. The company regularly hosted workshops, math camps,
                         and free tutoring sessions for underprivileged students in Johannesburg, reinforcing their commitment to educational equality and community upliftment. <br><br>
                         Today, Abacus Tutors stands as a beacon of educational excellence in Alberton, Johannesburg. With state-of-the-art facilities, a dedicated team of educators, and a proven track record of student success, the company continues to thrive. Callen Pulliah’s dream has not only been realized but has also paved the way for countless students to unlock their potential and achieve academic success in mathematics.
                          As Abacus Tutors looks to the future, it remains steadfast in its mission to nurture the next generation of mathematicians and problem solvers, one student at a time.
